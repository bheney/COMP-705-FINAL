# Spring 2024
# Full Stack Development Project

Developers per group: 2 - 3 

This project requires you to use Django to build a Web application that allows the user to interface with items such as cheeses, cars, movies, books, sandwich ordering, etc.  Check with the instructor if you are unsure of a topic.  You will use class-based views; Cookiecutter is optional.  

In the early development of your project, the instructor might add required features to your project.  

This project is a team endeavor; Each team will consist of 2 - 3 students.  Groups are expected to assign work to individual members of the team and keep track of work completed.  For example, not every programmer in a group will figure out how to create and use a Django form; assign this to one programmer.  You MAY NOT say in your reports that everyone worked on everything.  

The project will include a shared Github repository.  Be sure to share with the instructor as well (kgitlitz).  You will create Git branches for new features.  Merge features into the main branch; do not use rebase and do not delete branches.  Branches are evidence of your work.  

You may use an existing project as long as it was not built in a previous version of this course.  See the instructor if you are not sure.
